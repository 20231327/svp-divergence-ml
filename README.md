This repository contains the full machine learning pipeline developed for the thesis “Modeling and Understanding Sound Velocity Profile Divergence: An Explainable Machine Learning Approach Using ARMOR-3D.”
The workflow is organized as modular, version-controlled Python notebooks and scripts that perform:

- Data ingestion and stratified sampling
- SVP Spread Calculation and Analysis
- Feature engineering and preprocessing
- Model training and comparison
- SHAP-based interpretability analysis
- Descriptive visualizations and aggregated statistics

Each step is documented and can be executed independently or as part of the complete workflow.
